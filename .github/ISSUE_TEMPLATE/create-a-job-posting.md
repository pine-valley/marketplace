### Description
- Describe WHY a company was started with specific examples. Stay away from terms like “We wanted to improve Industry X” and go with “We have seen people hit problem X, problem Y, and problem Z in Industry X. Our company fixes it because our product does X”
- Why does the world need you company to be successful? What specifically do you want to happen? The person I talked to wanted to prove that you could pay people decent wages and still be successful in an industry notorious for taking advantage of workers. They were going to use technology in a way no one else had thought of.

### Responsibilities
- Describe some specific projects that a candidate may actually work on! The excuse for not doing this is usually that it is hard to know what a candidate may work on since they will start weeks or months after the job posting. EVERY company has a backlog that’s months if not years long. It shouldn’t be hard to pick a few things.
- Managers like to ask their directs what they want in 5 years. What about having companies describe what they expect a candidate to be able to look back on 5 years from now if they joined?
- Every company lists competitive salary as a benefit (even the ones that are notorious for underpaying staff). How about something more important: have the potential manager write about their management style and how they will help a candidate grow their career.
- Have some of the existing team members write about things they have learned while working at the company.
- Candidates like to ask “what is a typical day like?” in interviews. It is a terrible question because days are rarely typical as a software developer. However, that doesn’t mean some of the existing team members can’t describe a handful of days they had such as first day, 30th day, a day in the past week, etc.
